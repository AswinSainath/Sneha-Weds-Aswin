      <p>
        Kasi Yatra is a symbolic ritual in which the groom pretends to leave for Kashi (Varanasi) to become a sanyasi (monk), renouncing worldly life. 
        He is then persuaded to return and accept marriage. 
        This ritual symbolizes the choice of married life over renunciation and honors the importance of family life.<br>

        Oonjal is a pre-wedding ritual in which the bride and groom sit on a decorated swing. Women sing traditional songs while elders gently swing the couple. 
        Rice balls, flowers, or milk are waved around them to ward off the evil eye, and blessings are given by elders. 
        This ritual symbolizes balance, harmony, and mutual support in married life.

        Muhurtham is the most auspicious time chosen according to astrology for performing the main wedding ceremony. 
        It is believed to bring prosperity, harmony, and a long-lasting married life. 
        Important wedding rituals such as Kanyadaanam, Mangalsutra (Thaali) tying, and Saptapadi are performed during this time. 
        The marriage becomes official and sacred at the Muhurtham.
